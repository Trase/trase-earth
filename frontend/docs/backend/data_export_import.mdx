# Data Export / Import process

The application has built-in functionality which allows for copying the database from one instance to another in two steps:
- export: using the admin tool of the instance whose database is copied (source) run the 'Export database' process, which will:
    - dump the database using `pg_dump` + `gzip`
    - upload the dump to S3
- import: using the admin tool of the instance where we want the database copied to (target) run the 'Import database' process, which will:
    - download requested database dump from S3
    - check if schema version is compatible
    - backup current database
    - restore using `psql` into current database

Both processes run in background using sidekiq and exceptions can be monitored using Sidekiq Web UI - the 'Dead' section.

However, it is also possible to start them synchronously using rake tasks:
- `bundle exec rake db:s3:export`
- `DATABASE_VERSION=[object name from S3] bundle exec rake db:s3:import`

The import task checks whether your old database was at the same version (last migration) as the one you want to import and prevents you from accidentally getting into the hell of code - database mismatch. However, if you know what you're doing, you can override it: `DATABASE_VERSION=[object name from S3] bundle exec rake db:s3:force_import`
