# Tools to generate CARTO maps

## Generate vector map layers

This is needed when an update is needed on the map's vector layers, aka TopoJSON files used in the Leaflet map, for instance when adding countries or subnational entities, or when needing an extra column, etc. A CARTO API key is not needed to run this.

Vector layers are generated with one of the two workflows:
- CARTO (remote DB) -> geoJSON -> topoJSON
- local shapefiles -> geoJSON -> topoJSON

All can be generated by running:
```
cd frontend
./gis/vector_maps/getVectorMaps.sh
```

All dependencies should be installed by yarn install, except ogr2ogr (used for shapefile conversion), which you have to install globally with GDAL.

### Generate municipalities by state TopoJSON files (only for Brazil for now)

Those are the maps used by D3 in place profile pages.

```
cd frontend
./gis/vector_maps/main.sh
```

## Generate CARTO named maps (context layers)

This is necessary when context maps stored in CARTO tables need to be updated. A CARTO API key is needed.

- Add CARTO credentials to your `.env`:
```
CARTO_ACCOUNT=
CARTO_TOKEN=
```
- To update or instantiate context layers run
```
yarn named-maps -- --env=**type the environment**
```
This will use the layers configuration stored in `frontend/gis/cartodb/templates.**environment**.json`, to create a named map for each item. Then, a JS file to be used by the front-end is created at `cd frontend/scripts/actions/map/context_layers_carto.js`. This file contains the unique name for the created template as well as the layergroupid. The rest of the configuration (legend, title) is located in the constants.

- Add the following to your `.env` to run the application using the desired named maps environment:
```
NAMED_MAPS_ENV=**environment**
```
