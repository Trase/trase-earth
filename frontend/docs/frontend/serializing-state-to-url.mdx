# Serializing state to url

## State flow

```txt
A: Reads search from the url and parses it into query params object.
B: Apply custom deserializers and extract them as initial state to each reducer/state slice.
C: Renders <UrlSerializer /> with the props that the component expects to serialize.
D: Applies custom serializers.
E: Calls the serialize function (router agnostic) with the current query, the serialized props and the props to remove.
F: URL renders state.

## Reading state from URL into the store (deserialization)

We create the `preloadedState` using the `deserialize` method.

### deserialize

This method expects a configuration object with the following signature:

```js
const deserializeConfig = {
  props: Array,
  params: Object,
  state: Object,
  urlPropHandlers: {
    [propName]: {
      parse: value => parsedValue,
      stringify: (value, DONT_SERIALIZE) => stringifiedValue
    }
  }
};
```

- **params:** Query params, obtained by parsing the current url search string. To do this we use the `query-string` lib and we pass the search using the window object `window.location.search`.
  However, the deserialize method doesnt care about where the initial query params come, thus making it possible to work with server side rendering.
- **initialState:** Object containing the initial state of the state slice where the props we're deserializing live.
- **urlPropHandlers:** Object containing keys with props that need custom parse handlers. Each key's value should be an object with a property function named `parse`.
- **props:** Array containing the prop names to read from the url and save into the state slice.

## Rendering state to the URL

We render a `<UrlSerializer />` component in the page we wish to serialize state. We pass the props that we want to serialize as `urlProps` using selectors and provide `urlPropHandlers` to customise the serialization.

### Passing props to the component

To pass the state we want to serialize we create a selector per reducer, which returns an object that has the name of the prop to serialize and the current value.

```js
const urlProps = { [propName]: propValue };
```

### Applying custom serialization

To apply special treatment to a particular prop we need to define a url prop handler. This handler is the same used in the parse stage to apply a custom parse function. In this case we need to add the `stringify` method.

### Saving stringified values into the URL

To save values into the URL the `<UrlSerializer />` calls the `serialize` method that's passed as prop.
This way the serialization is agnostic of the state management and the router solutions.
This function will receive the current query params, the updated version and the props that have been removed. The `deserialize` method has the following signature:

```js
const serialize = (query: Object, urlProps: Object, removedProps?: Array) => void
```

Currently we're leveraging _Redux-First-Router's_ `redirect` method to update the state, but could work with any other mechanism such as `window.location.replace` method.
